# NYSE-Data-Project


In this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of two sub-industries: Gold and Steel, utilizing historical financial data from the New York Stock Exchange. I employed statistical techniques to interpret measures of central tendency and spread, including mean, median, standard deviation, and range. Additionally, I created visualizations to illustrate key insights and trends, and developed a Profit and Loss (P&L) statement dashboard to analyze financial metrics. This project enhanced my proficiency in data analysis using Excel and strengthened my ability to derive actionable insights from financial data.
